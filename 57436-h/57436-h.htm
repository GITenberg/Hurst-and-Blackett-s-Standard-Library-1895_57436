    <div>I.—SAM SLICK’S NATURE AND HUMAN NATURE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“The first volume of Messrs. Hurst and Blackett’s Standard Library of Cheap Editions
forms a very good beginning to what will doubtless be a very successful undertaking.
‘Nature and Human Nature’ is one of the best of Sam Slick’s witty and humorous productions,
and well entitled to the large circulation which it cannot fail to obtain in its
present convenient and cheap shape. The volume combines with the great recommendations
of a clear, bold type and good paper, the lesser, but attractive merits of being well
illustrated and elegantly bound.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>II.—JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“The new and cheaper edition of this interesting work will doubtless meet with great
success. John Halifax, the hero of this most beautiful story, is no ordinary hero, and
no ordinary book. It is a full-length portrait of a true gentleman, one
of nature’s own nobility. It is also the history of a home, and a thoroughly English one.
The work abounds in incident, and many of the scenes are full of graphic power and true
pathos. It is a book that few will read without becoming wiser and better.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“This story is very interesting. The attachment between John Halifax and his wife is
beautifully painted, as are the pictures of their domestic life, and the growing up of their
children; and the conclusion of the book is beautiful and touching.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>III.—THE CRESCENT AND THE CROSS.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY ELIOT WARBURTON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Independent of its value as an original narrative, and its useful and interesting
information, this work is remarkable for the colouring power and play of fancy with
which its descriptions are enlivened. Among its greatest and most lasting charms is its
reverent and serious spirit.”—<i>Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Warburton has fulfilled the promise of his title-page. The ‘Realities of Eastern
Travel’ are described with a vividness which invests them with deep and abiding interest;
while the ‘Romantic’ adventures which the enterprising tourist met with in his
course are narrated with a spirit which shows how much he enjoyed these reliefs from
the ennui of every-day life.”—<i>Globe.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>IV.—NATHALIE.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY JULIA KAVANAGH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“‘Nathalie’ is Miss Kavanagh’s best imaginative effort. Its manner is gracious and
attractive. Its matter is good. A sentiment, a tenderness, are commanded by her which
are as individual as they are elegant. We should not soon come to an end were we to
specify all the delicate touches and attractive pictures which place ‘Nathalie’ high among
books of its class.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>V.—A WOMAN’S THOUGHTS ABOUT WOMEN.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“These thoughts are good and humane. They are thoughts we would wish women to
think: they are much more to the purpose than the treatises upon the women and daughters
of England, which were fashionable some years ago, and these thoughts mark the
progress of opinion, and indicate a higher tone of character, and a juster estimate of
woman’s position.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“This excellent book is characterised by good sense, good taste, and feeling, and is
written in an earnest, philanthropic, as well as practical spirit.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>VI.—ADAM GRAEME OF MOSSGRAY.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY MRS. OLIPHANT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“‘Adam Graeme’ is a story awakening genuine emotions of interest and delight by its
admirable pictures of Scottish life and scenery. The plot is cleverly complicated, and
there is great vitality in the dialogue, and remarkable brilliancy in the descriptive passages,
as who that has read ‘Margaret Maitland’ would not be prepared to expect?
But the story has a ‘mightier magnet still,’ in the healthy tone which pervades it, in its
feminine delicacy of thought and diction, and in the truly womanly tenderness of its
sentiments. The eloquent author sets before us the essential attributes of Christian
virtue, their deep and silent workings in the heart, and their beautiful manifestations in
the life, with a delicacy, a power, and a truth which can hardly be surpassed.”—<i>Morning
Post.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>VII.—SAM SLICK’S WISE SAWS AND MODERN INSTANCES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“We have not the slightest intention to criticise this book. Its reputation is made, and
will stand as long as that of Scott’s or Bulwer’s novels. The remarkable originality of
its purpose, and the happy description it affords of American life and manners, still continue
the subject of universal admiration. To say thus much is to say enough, though we
must just mention that the new edition forms a part of the Publishers’ Cheap Standard
Library, which has included some of the very best specimens of light literature that ever
have been written.”—<i>Messenger.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>VIII.—CARDINAL WISEMAN’S RECOLLECTIONS OF THE LAST FOUR POPES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“A picturesque book on Rome and its ecclesiastical sovereigns, by an eloquent Roman
Catholic. Cardinal Wiseman has here treated a special subject with so much generality
and geniality that his recollections will excite no ill-feeling in those who are most conscientiously
opposed to every idea of human infallibility represented in Papal domination.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>IX.—A LIFE FOR A LIFE.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“‘A Life for a Life’ is a book of a high class. The characters are depicted with a
masterly hand; the events are dramatically set forth; the descriptions of scenery and
sketches of society are admirably penned; moreover, the work has an object—a clearly
defined moral—most poetically, most beautifully drawn, and through all there is that
strong, reflective mind visible which lays bare the human heart and human mind to the
very core.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>X.—THE OLD COURT SUBURB.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY LEIGH HUNT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“A book which has afforded us no slight gratification.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“From the mixture of description, anecdote, biography, and criticism, this book is very
pleasant reading.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“A more agreeable and entertaining book has not been published since Boswell produced
his reminiscences of Johnson.”—<i>Observer.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>XI.—MARGARET AND HER BRIDESMAIDS.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE VALLEY OF A HUNDRED FIRES.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“We recommend all who are in search of a fascinating novel to read this work for
themselves. They will find it well worth their while. There are a freshness and originality
about it quite charming, and there is a certain nobleness in the treatment both or
sentiment and incident which is not often found.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>XII.—THE OLD JUDGE; OR, LIFE IN A COLONY.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY SAM SLICK.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“A peculiar interest attaches to sketches of colonial life, and readers could not have a
safer guide than the talented author of this work, who, by a residence of half a century,
has practically grasped the habits, manners, and social conditions of the colonists he describes.
All who wish to form a fair idea of the difficulties and pleasures of life in a new
country, unlike England in some respects, yet like it in many, should read this book.”—<i>John Bull.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>XIII.—DARIEN; OR, THE MERCHANT PRINCE.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY ELIOT WARBURTON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“This last production of the author of ‘The Crescent and the Cross’ has the same
elements of a very wide popularity. It will please its thousands.”—<i>Globe.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“Eliot Warburton’s active and productive genius is amply exemplified in the present
book. We have seldom met with any work in which the realities of history and the
poetry of fiction were more happily interwoven.”—<i>Illustrated News.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>XIV.—FAMILY ROMANCE; OR, DOMESTIC ANNALS OF THE ARISTOCRACY.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY SIR BERNARD BURKE, ULSTER KING OF ARMS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“It were impossible to praise too highly this most interesting book, whether we should
have regard to its excellent plan or its not less excellent execution. It ought to be found
on every drawing-room table. Here you have nearly fifty captivating romances with the
pith of all their interest preserved in undiminished poignancy, and any one may be read
in half an hour. It is not the least of their merits that the romances are founded on fact—or
what, at least, has been handed down for truth by long tradition—and the romance
reality far exceeds the romance of fiction.”—<i>Standard.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>XV.—THE LAIRD OF NORLAW.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY MRS. OLIPHANT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“We have had frequent opportunities of commending Messrs. Hurst and Blackett’s
Standard Library. For neatness, elegance, and distinctness the volumes in this series
surpass anything with which we are familiar. ‘The Laird of Norlaw’ will fully sustain
the author’s high reputation. The reader is carried on from first to last with an energy
of sympathy that never flags.”—<i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“‘The Laird of Norlaw’ is worthy of the author’s reputation. It is one of the most
exquisite of modern novels.”—<i>Observer.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>XVI.—THE ENGLISHWOMAN IN ITALY.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY MRS. G. GRETTON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Gretton had opportunities which rarely fall to the lot of strangers of becoming
acquainted with the inner life and habits of a part of the Italian peninsula which is the
very centre of the national crisis. We can praise her performance as interesting, unexaggerated,
and full of opportune instruction.”—<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Gretton’s book is timely, life-like, and for every reason to be recommended. It
is impossible to close the book without liking the writer as well as the subject. The work
is engaging, because real.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>XVII.—NOTHING NEW.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“‘Nothing New’ displays all those superior merits which have made ‘John Halifax’
one of the most popular works of the day. There is a force and truthfulness about these
tales which mark them as the production of no ordinary mind, and we cordially recommend
them to the perusal of all lovers of fiction.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>XVIII.—LIFE OF JEANNE D’ALBRET, QUEEN OF NAVARRE.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY MARTHA WALKER FREER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“We have read this book with great pleasure, and have no hesitation in recommending
it to general perusal. It reflects the highest credit on the industry and ability of Miss
Freer. Nothing can be more interesting than her story of the life of Jeanne D’Albret,
and the narrative is as trustworthy as it is attractive.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class='c006' />

    <div>XIX.—THE VALLEY OF A HUNDRED FIRES.</div>
    <div class='c003'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “MARGARET AND HER BRIDESMAIDS.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“If asked to classify this work, we should give it a place between ‘John Halifax’ and
‘The Caxtons.’”—<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“The spirit in which the whole book is written is refined and good.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“This is in every sense a charming novel.”—<i>Messenger.</i></p>

    <div class='c003'>BY PETER BURKE, SERJEANT AT LAW.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“This attractive book will be perused with much interest. It contains a great variety
of singular and highly romantic stories.”—<i>John Bull.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“A work of singular interest, which can never fail to charm and absorb the reader’s
attention. The present cheap and elegant edition includes the true story of the Colleen
Bawn.”—<i>Illustrated News.</i></p>

    <div class='c003'>BY JULIA KAVANAGH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“‘Adèle’ is the best work we have read by Miss Kavanagh; it is a charming story,
full of delicate character-painting. The interest kindled in the first chapter burns brightly
to the close.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Adèle’ will fully sustain the reputation of Miss Kavanagh, high as it already ranks.”—<i>John Bull.</i></p>

    <div class='c003'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“These ‘Studies’ are truthful and vivid pictures of life, often earnest, always full of right
feeling, and occasionally lightened by touches of quiet, genial humour. The volume is remarkable
for thought, sound sense, shrewd observation, and kind and sympathetic feeling
for all things good and beautiful.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“These ‘Studies from Life’ are remarkable for graphic power and observation. The
book will not diminish the reputation of the accomplished author.”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>“A book to be read and re-read; fit for the study as well as the drawing-room table and
the circulating library.”—<i>Lancet.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“This is a pleasant book for the fireside season, and for the seaside season. Mr. Jeaffreson
has, out of hundreds of volumes, collected thousands of good things, adding thereto
much that appears in print for the first time, and which, of course, gives increased value
to this very readable book.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

with great ability. This cheap and handsome new edition is worthy to pass freely from

pathetic interest is sustained by an art of which it would be difficult to analyse the secret
It is a choice gift to be able thus to render human nature so truly, to penetrate its depths

entertaining than another, and all of them graphically illustrative of the ways and manners
of brother Jonathan. The anomalies of American law, the extraordinary adventures

But the story has a ‘mightier magnet still,’ in the healthy tone which pervades it, in its

    <div>THE AWAKENING OF MARY FENWICK.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“We have no hesitation in declaring that ‘The Awakening of Mary Fenwick’ is the
best novel of its kind that we have seen for some years. It is apparently a first effort,
and, as such, is really remarkable. The story is extremely simple. Mary Mauser marries
her husband for external, and perhaps rather inadequate, reasons, and then discovers
that he married her because she was an heiress. She feels the indignity acutely, and
does not scruple to tell him her opinion—her very candid opinion—of his behaviour. That
is the effect of the first few chapters, and the rest of Miss Whitby’s book is devoted to
relating how this divided couple hated, quarrelled, and finally fell in love with one another.
Mary Fenwick and her husband live and move and make us believe in them in a way
which few but the great masters of fiction have been able to compass.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

    <div>ONE REASON WHY.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c008'>“Our old friend the governess makes a re-entry into fiction under the auspices of Beatrice
Whitby in ‘One Reason Why.’ Readers generally, however, will take a great deal
more interest, for once, in the children than in their instructress. ‘Bay’ and ‘Ellie’ are
charmingly natural additions to the children of novel-land; so much so, that there is a
period when one dreads a death-bed scene for one of them—a fear which is happily unfulfilled.
The name of the authoress will be remembered by many in conjunction with
‘The Awakening of Mary Fenwick.’”—<i>Graphic.</i></p>

    <div>PART OF THE PROPERTY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“The book is a thoroughly good one. The theme is fairly familiar—the rebellion of a
spirited girl against a match which has been arranged for her without her knowledge or
consent; her resentment at being treated, not as a woman with a heart and will, but as
‘part of the property’; and her final discovery, which is led up to with real dramatic skill,
that the thing against which her whole nature had risen in revolt has become the one
desire of her heart. The mutual relations each to each of the impetuous Madge, her self-willed,
stubborn grandfather, who has arranged the match, and her lover Jocelyn, with
his loyal, devoted sweetly-balanced nature, are portrayed with fine truth of insight; but
perhaps the author’s greatest triumph is the portrait of Mrs. Lindsay, who, with the
knowledge of the terrible skeleton in the cupboard of her apparently happy home, wears
so bravely the mask of light gaiety as to deceive everybody but the one man who knows
her secret.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

    <div>IN THE SUNTIME OF HER YOUTH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“A description of a home stripped by the cold wind of poverty of all its comforts, but
which remains home still. The careless optimism of the head of the family would be incredible,
if we did not know how men exist full of responsibilities yet free from solicitudes,
and who tread with a jaunty step the very verge of ruin; his inconsolable widow
would be equally improbable, if we did not meet every day with women who devote themselves
to such idols of clay. The characters of their charming children, whose penury we
deplore, do not deteriorate, as often happens in that cruel ordeal. A sense of fairness
pervades the book which is rarely found in the work of a lady. There is interest in it
from first to last, and its pathos is relieved by touches of true humour.”—<i>Illustrated

he is, finds some difficulty in forgiving the <i>insouciante</i> mistress all her little sins of omission
and commission. When she finally shoots him in the leg—by accident—the real
tragedy of the story begins. The whole is admirable, if a little long.”—<i>Black and White.</i></p>

    <div>ROBERT CARROLL.</div>
    <div class='c003'>By the Author of ‘<span class='sc'>Mistress Beatrice Cope</span>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“M. E. Le Clerc devotes herself to historic fiction, and her success is sufficient to justify
her in the occasional production of stories like ‘Mistress Beatrice Cope’ and ‘Robert Carroll.’
Beatrice Cope was a Jacobite’s daughter, so far as memory serves, and Robert Carroll
was the son of a Jacobite baronet, who played and lost his stake at Preston, fighting for the
Old Pretender. Of course the hero loved a maiden whose father was a loyal servant of
King George, and, almost equally of course one of this maiden’s brothers was a Jacobite.
A second brother, by the way, appears as a lad of sixteen in the spring of 1714, and as a
wounded colonel of cavalry on the morrow of the fight at Preston less than two years
later—rapid promotion even for those days, though certainly not impossible. The author
has taken pains to be accurate in her references to the events of the time, and her blend
of fact and fiction is romantic enough.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

    <div>THE HUSBAND OF ONE WIFE.</div>
    <div class='c003'>By the Author of ‘<span class='sc'>Some Married Fellows</span>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“It is a comfort to turn from the slipshod English and the tiresome slang of many
modern novels to the easy and cultured style of ‘The Husband of One Wife,’ and we have
been thoroughly interested in the story, as well as pleased with the manner in which it is
told. As for Mrs. Goldenour, afterwards Mrs. Garfoyle, afterwards Mrs. Pengelley, she is
certainly one of the most attractive as well as one of the most provoking of heroines, and
Mrs. Venn has succeeded admirably in describing her under both aspects. The scene of
the dinner-party, and the description of the bishop’s horror at its magnificence is very
clever. We are very glad to meet several old friends again, especially Mrs. Gruter, who
is severe and amusing as ever. Altogether we feel that Mrs. Venn’s novels are books to
which we can confidently look forward with pleasure.”—<i>Guardian.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>“The story will be followed with unfaltering interest. Nor is anything short of unmixed
praise due to several of the episodes and separate incidents of which it is composed.
The principal characters—Delmar, Zoé’s cousin and lover—stand out in decided and life-like
relief. In the sketches of scenery, especially those of the coast of Brittany and the
aspect of its sea, both in calm and storm, Miss Betham-Edwards need not fear comparison
with the best masters of the art.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“The book is one that may be read with pleasure; it is fluently, flowingly, carefully
written; and it contains very pleasant sketches of character.”—<i>Academy.</i></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
